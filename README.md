# ANN-DL-Competition1

This homework assignment is structured as a binary classification problem where you need to predict classes for images in a test set, using a model trained on a provided training set. The competition is divided into two phases, and your performance will be evaluated based on accuracy. Here is a step-by-step guide to complete this homework:

### Phase 1: Development Phase
1. **Analyze the Training Data:** Begin by exploring the provided training data. Understand its structure, format, and the nature of the images.

2. **Preprocess the Data:** Depending on your findings, apply necessary preprocessing steps like normalization, augmentation, etc., to prepare the data for training.

3. **Model Development:** Create a binary classification model using TensorFlow, as this is the primary library available in the competition's environment. Consider using architectures known for image classification like CNNs.

4. **Training:** Train your model on the training dataset. Implement strategies like cross-validation to optimize the model's performance.

5. **Local Testing:** Test your model locally using a part of the training set as a pseudo-test set to estimate its performance.

6. **Prepare Submission:** Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, prepare your submission. This should include the `model.py` file with the model's definition, including `__init__` and `predict` functions, and an empty `metadata` file.

7. **Submit for Evaluation:** Upload your submission to the competition platform for evaluation against the hidden test set. Monitor your performance on the leaderboard.

### Phase 2: Final Phase
1. **Re-evaluate Your Model:** Based on your results from Phase 1, make any necessary adjustments to your model.

2. **Final Submission:** You are allowed up to two submissions in this phase. Choose the best version of your model for submission.

3. **Submission Preparation:** Follow the same format as in Phase 1 for preparing your submission.

### Additional Requirements
- **Final Report:** Prepare a 3-page report detailing your approach, methodologies, experiments, and findings. The report should be concise, technical, and well-structured, including illustrations and clear descriptions.
- **Code Documentation:** Ensure your submitted code is well-commented and documented, explaining the functions, variables, and key steps.
- **Contributions Section:** Include a section in your report outlining the specific contributions of each team member.

### Email Submission
- **Compose an Email:** Follow the specified format, including team member details, leaderboard nickname, and attachments (code and report).
- **Attachments:** Attach the `LEADERBOARD_NICKNAME.zip` file containing your notebooks or Python scripts and the 3-page report.

### Important Notes
- **Consistency with Report:** Your code and experiments should align with what is described in your report.
- **Active Links:** If you're using external links, ensure they remain active for at least two months.
- **Formatting:** The report should be in Calibri, Times New Roman, or Arial, with a size of 11.
- **Adherence to Specifications:** Strictly follow all specified requirements for the email content and attachments.

### Final Tips
- **Experiment Systematically:** Conduct thorough experiments, including ablation studies and testing alternative architectures.
- **Optimize Performance:** Focus on improving the accuracy of your model, as this is the key evaluation metric.
- **Quality Over Quantity:** In your report and code, prioritize clarity, technical soundness, and conciseness.

Following these steps and tips should guide you effectively through the homework assignment.
