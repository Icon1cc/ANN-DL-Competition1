## Homework 1: Image Classification

### Challenge Overview
Develop a model for binary classification of plant health.

#### Repository Structure
- `Challenge_1/`
  - `Data/`: Training dataset of RGB plant images.
  - `Submission/`: Contains `model.py` and metadata.
  - `Test_Models/`: Scripts and notebooks for testing models.
  - `The_Avengers/`: Team's final submission files.

#### Data Details
- Image size: 96x96, Color space: RGB, Format: .npz
- Classes: {0: "healthy", 1: "unhealthy"}

#### Model Development
- Utilized TensorFlow and Keras for a binary classification model.
- Model evaluated on accuracy.

#### Submission Requirements
- Final submission emailed to an2dl.competitions@gmail.com.

#### Usage
- Clone the repository and follow instructions in `Test_Models/`.

#### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to course instructors and team members.

## Homework 2: Time Series Forecasting

### Challenge Overview
Forecasting future values of uncorrelated time series.

#### Repository Structure
- `Challenge_2/`
  - `Dataset/`: Training data for model development.
  - `Practice Models/`: Preliminary model trials.
  - `Final Submission/Final Model/`: Definitive models and scripts.
  - `Team Models/`: Space for collaborative model development.

#### Data Details
