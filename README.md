# ANN-DL Competition1: Binary Image Classification Challenge

Welcome to the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2023 course's first homework assignment. This challenge involves a binary classification task to classify plant images based on their health state.

## Overview

In this homework, you are tasked to predict classes for images in a test set using a model trained on a provided training set. The competition is divided into two phases with a focus on accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Task

- **Dataset:** Access the dataset from the 'Participate/Get Data' page on CodaLab. Familiarize yourself with the number of images, their dimensions, and class distribution.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Review the evaluation criteria on the 'Learn the Details/Evaluation' page. Accuracy is the key metric for evaluation.

### Setting Up Your Environment

- **Google Form Subscription:** Ensure your CodaLab details match those submitted in the Google Form, including email and team name.
- **Development Environment:**
  - **Local Setup:** For GPU support, follow TensorFlow's GPU support guide.
  - **Cloud Options:** Utilize Google Colaboratory or Kaggle for free GPU resources, within usage limits.

## Development Phase

### Data Preparation

- **Preprocessing:** Implement resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to prepare the images for your neural network.

### Model Development

- **Framework:** Use TensorFlow and Keras for model development.
- **Architecture:** Start with CNNs and experiment with various layers and hyperparameters.
- **Training:** Employ strategies like validation splits, early stopping, and checkpointing.
- **Local Evaluation:** Test your model locally using a validation set or cross-validation.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Code Requirements:** Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and follows the submission guidelines on CodaLab.
- **Forum Participation:** Engage in the competition forum for discussions and idea exchanges.

## Competition Phases

### Phase 1: Development Phase

- **Analyze Training Data:** Understand the training data's structure and nature.
- **Prepare Submission:** Include `model.py` and an empty `metadata` file.
- **Submit for Evaluation:** Monitor performance on the leaderboard.

### Phase 2: Final Phase

- **Model Re-evaluation:** Adjust your model based on Phase 1 outcomes.
- **Final Submission:** You're allowed up to two submissions.

## Additional Requirements

- **Final Report:** Prepare a detailed 3-page report in Calibri, Times New Roman, or Arial (size 11).
- **Code Documentation:** Comment your code thoroughly.
- **Contributions Section:** Clearly outline each team member's contributions.

## Email Submission

- **Email Format:** Follow the specified format with team details and attachments.
- **Attachments:** Include `LEADERBOARD_NICKNAME.zip` with your code and report.

## Tips for Success

- **Simplicity:** Start with a basic model and enhance complexity gradually.
- **Systematic Experimentation:** Track experiments and their outcomes.
- **Resource Utilization:** Use Google Colab or Kaggle if lacking a local GPU.
- **Backup Regularly:** Especially when working on cloud platforms.
- **Stay Informed:** Follow forum discussions for updates and insights.

## Final Note

Remember, this is a collaborative learning experience. Engage with your classmates and share insights to enhance your understanding and performance.
